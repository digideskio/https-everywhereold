<!--
	For rules that are on by default, see Reddit.xml.


	The following domains are not covered, either due to bad CN or no HTTPS:

		* s0.2mdn.net - has https, bad cert CN (not sure what this domain actually provides)
		* pixel.redditmedia.com - seems some sort of ad tracking, possibly can be sent to /dev/null; didn't find
					  anything broken when I blocked the domain.  Doesn't seem to be used anymore.
		* www.redditmedia.com - seems only/mostly to be used for ads
